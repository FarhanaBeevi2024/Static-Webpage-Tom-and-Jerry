    <h1>Tom and Jerry </h1>
    <p><b>Tom and Jerry</b> is an American animated media franchise and series of comedy short films created in 1940 by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. Best known for its 161 theatrical short films by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the series centers on the rivalry between the titular characters of a cat named Tom and a mouse named Jerry. Many shorts also feature several recurring characters.</p>
    <p><b>Tom and Jerry</b> The Movie premiered in 1992 in Europe and appeared on American screens the following year. In 2006 Warner Bros. debuted a new television series, Tom and Jerry Tales, which was closely modeled after the original theatrical shorts. Tom and Jerry (2021), a mix of live action and animation, was a surprise box office hit, grossing more than $100 million worldwide..</p>

<p>After Hanna and Barbera left MGM, the series was revived several times, most notably in the mid-1960s under the direction of famed animator <b>Chuck Jones.</b> These later versions changed certain elements of the series and softened the violence. The shorts became popular on television, and Hanna and Barbera’s own company acquired the rights to create new Tom and Jerry episodes specifically for the small screen, producing 48 stories between 1975 and 1977. The show remained a television staple for decades, although racist or other offensive elements from the early features were usually edited.</p>

<p> Today, Warner Bros.

<h1>CHUCK JONES</h1>
<p><b>Chuck Jones</b>is an American animation director of critically acclaimed cartoon shorts, primarily the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies film series at Warner Bros. studios.As a youth, Jones often observed film comedians such as Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton performing before the cameras on the local streets of Los Angeles. Their timing and slapstick pantomimes strongly influenced Jones’s comic sensibilities. He studied at the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles, and, after working briefly at the studio of former Walt Disney associate Ub Iwerks, Jones in 1933 signed on as an assistant animator with the Warner Bros. cartoon unit run by Leon Schlesinger. He directed his first short, The Night Watchman, in 1938; like most of Jones’s early efforts, it emulated Disney’s timing, pacing, and design.</p>

 <h1>LATEST NEWS</h1>
 <p><b>Warner Bros.</b>Discovery has revealed an upcoming Southeast Asia-localized version of Tom and Jerry, along with a brief teaser showing what the updated characters will look like in the new series.</p>
 <p> The seven, three-minute shorts will feature the cartoon cat and mouse playing their endless game among the most recognizable landmarks of Singapore. The series is the first localized version of the IP, but it’s worth noting that just last year WBD released a series of cutesy T&J shorts in Japan. The difference is that while the Japanese shorts were done in a distinctive kawaii/anime style, they were still set in a traditional Tom and Jerry universe. For the new Singapore episodes, the studio went to great lengths to create distinctly Singaporean scenarios. That has never been done before outside of the U.S. </P>

 <p>During the first half of 2006, a new series called Tom and Jerry Tales was produced at Warner Bros. Animation. Thirteen half-hour episodes (each consisting of three shorts) were produced, with only markets outside of the United States and United Kingdom signed up. The show then came to the U.K. in February 2006 on Boomerang, and it went to the U.S. on Kids' WB! on The WB. Tales is the first Tom and Jerry TV series that utilizes the original style of the classic shorts, along with the violence. This recently is the last Tom and Jerry-based cartoon show for television as the show ended on March 22, 2008.</p>
